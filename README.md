📁 Operating Systems Lab – Practical Implementation in Linux
Welcome to my OS Lab Repository — a curated collection of hands-on experiments that bring core Operating System concepts to life using Linux commands and C programs.

🚀 What’s Inside?

🔧 Lab 1–3: Mastery over essential Linux commands, permission handling, and directory structures.

🧱 Lab 4–6: Process creation, memory management, CPU scheduling, and inter-process communication.

🧟‍♂️ Lab 7–8: Advanced process handling including zombie and orphan process simulations.

Each lab showcases:

Real terminal commands 🖥️

Bash & C program implementations

Practical scenarios with step-by-step outputs

Clean formatting for readability and learning

💡 "Because operating systems aren't just theory—they're the pulse of computing."
